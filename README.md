# fifa-search-npm
## About

A Node.JS app that loops through a mentioned database containing players' information (from Kaggle) and filters the entirety of it just to match the query of obtaining someone by searching their name.

## How to use

* cd to the cloned directory having the "index.js" file
* Run `npm run start` (only after installing Node.js)
* Navigate to localhost:9999 through your preferred web browser

## What does it do?

* Searches for a player by their name (e.g. Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar) after clicking on the "Search" button
* Do NOT even think about entering nothing in the input box if you have a below-average system only for office work
* Use the "Clear" button in case of lag due to searching for a large number of players.
